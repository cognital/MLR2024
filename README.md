## General Information
- Bike sharing assignment is a part of multi linear regression modelling.
- A real world scenario where a bike-sharing provider aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
- Business goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables, to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- A bike sharing dataset is used for the analysis and model building. This dataset has different parameters recorded that are related to bike sharing for the year 2018-2019

## Conclusions
- A few variable did show a linear relationship with the target variable. Thus MLR assumption follows.
- temp and atemp have positive and strong coorelation with cnt.
- The variables significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes are temperature, weather situation such as light snow, year, windspeed, season of spring, season of winter, mist and the month of July.
- R- squared value of 82% shows how well the variables describe the bike demands.
- The final model shows linear regression model assumptions such as linearity, independence, and homoscedasticity.
